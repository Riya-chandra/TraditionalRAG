Introduction  \\nModern  software  operates  in  dynamic,  unpredictable  environments  where  errors,  failures,  and  regressions  are  inevitable.  Production  outages,  flaky  test  failures,  and  performance  bottlenecks  demand  significant  human  effort  for  detection,  diagnosis,  and  recovery.  Despite  advances  in  monitoring,  alerting,  and  automated  testing,  most  software  systems  lack  the  ability  to  adaptively  respond  to  disruptions  without  manual  intervention,  leading  to  increased  downtime  and  developer  toil.  \\nIn  contrast,  biological  organisms  like  the  human  body  exhibit  remarkable  self-healing  capabilities.  The  body  detects  damage  through  sensory  signals,  processes  them  via  the  brain,  and  triggers  coordinated  healing  responses—such  as  immune  activation  or  tissue  regeneration—to  ensure  survival  and  adaptation.  Inspired  by  this  decentralized  yet  efficient  process,  we  propose  a  new  paradigm  in  software  engineering:  AI-driven  self-healing  systems  that  mimic  biological  resilience.  At  the  core  of  our  approach  is  an  AI-powered  decision-making  unit,  analogous  to  the  brain,  that  interprets  signals  from  logs,  tests,  and  runtime  metrics  to  autonomously  identify  issues  and  initiate  repairs.  \\nThis  paper  presents  a  conceptual  and  technical  framework  for  AI-driven  self-healing  in  software  applications.  Unlike  conventional  automated  repair  systems  that  rely  on  rigid  rule-based  mechanisms  or  static  scripts,  our  framework  \\nemphasizes  adaptability  and  continuous  learning.  By  leveraging  machine  learning,  program  synthesis,  anomaly  detection,  and  automated  code  refactoring,  AI-driven  agents  can  generate  precise  interventions—such  as  patching  code,  rewriting  failing  tests,  or  rerouting  execution  flows—enabling  resilient,  intelligent  self-healing  behaviors.  We  outline  the  following  contributions:  \\n●  Define  a  biologically  inspired  architecture  for  self-healing  software  (Section  4).  ●  Explore  key  AI  components  for  detection,  diagnosis,  and  automated  repair  (Sections  4  and  5).  ●  Present  use  cases  in  production  systems  and  test  automation  (Section  5).  ●  Evaluate  the  benefits,  limitations,  and  future  potential  of  autonomous  software  healing  (Sections  5–8).  \\nAs  software  systems  trend  toward  greater  autonomy,  self-healing  capabilities  will  become  foundational  to  their  design,  maintenance,  and  evolution.  This  study  lays  the  groundwork  for  that  vision,  integrating  principles  from  biology  and  artificial  intelligence  to  engineer  more  resilient,  self-aware  software  ecosystems.  \\n2.

This  intricate  system  is  orchestrated  by  the  brain,  sensory  networks,  the  immune  system,  and  regenerative  mechanisms.  Drawing  parallels  between  this  biological  resilience  and  software  systems  offers  a  compelling  framework  for  designing  self-healing  architectures.  \\n2.1.  The  Brain  as  the  Central  Controller  →  AI  Orchestration  Engine  \\nIn  biological  systems,  the  brain  receives,  processes,  and  acts  upon  a  constant  stream  of  sensory  data  to  initiate  appropriate  responses.  Similarly,  in  a  self-healing  software  system,  the  core  decision-making  entity  is  an  AI  orchestration  engine —powered  by  large  language  models  (LLMs),  retrieval-augmented  generation  (RAG),  or  reinforcement  learning  frameworks  [1][2].  This  engine  interprets  inputs  from  diverse  system  channels  and  triggers  healing  actions,  such  as  regenerating  tests,  rolling  back  faulty  commits,  or  applying  hotfixes.  \\n2.2.  Signals  and  Sensors  (Pain,  Inflammation)  →  Logs,  Monitoring,  Tracing  \\nBiological  signals  like  pain,  swelling,  or  fever  act  as  indicators  of  damage  or  infection.  Analogously,  modern  software  systems  emit  a  vast  array  of  signals  through  logs,  performance  metrics,  trace  events ,  and  anomaly  detection  systems  [3].  Tools  like  Prometheus,  Datadog,  or  OpenTelemetry  function  as  the  \"senses\"  of  the  software,  feeding  real-time  data  into  the  central  controller  for  evaluation.  \\n2.3.  Immune  System  and  Repair  Agents  →  Healing  Scripts,  AI  Repair  Models  \\nJust  as  the  immune  system  deploys  white  blood  cells  to  isolate  and  repair  tissue  damage,  self-healing  systems  can  invoke  automated  repair  agents —scripts  or  machine  learning  models  trained  on  historical  failures  and  code  change  patterns  [4].  These  agents  can  \\nauto-generate  patches,  update  test  cases,  or  even  suggest  alternative  logic  paths  based  on  semantic  understanding  of  the  failure.  \\n2.4.  Regeneration  and  Adaptation  →  Refactoring,  Re-tests,  Test  Regeneration  \\nSome  biological  organisms  possess  the  ability  to  regenerate  lost  tissues —such  as  skin  or  liver  cells.  In  software,  this  regenerative  property  manifests  in  the  form  of  refactoring ,  test  regeneration ,  or  resilient  fallback  code  paths .  Tools  like  GPT-based  test  writers  or  repair  frameworks  like  Prophet  and  Repairnator  [5]  can  learn  from  context  and  rewrite  or  enhance  faulty  components,  restoring  system  functionality  with  minimal  downtime.  \\n2.5.  Cellular  Memory  →  Version  History,  Git,  Observability  Stores  \\nBiological  cells  retain  memory  of  past  infections  (as  in  adaptive  immunity).  Software  achieves  similar  long-term  recall  through  version  control  systems  like  Git ,  combined  with  observability  platforms  that  store  historical  logs,  traces,  and  error  patterns  [6].  This  memory  allows  the  AI  engine  to  understand  recurring  issues,  predict  regressions,  and  refine  future  healing  strategies.  \\n \\n3.

This  section  reviews  advancements  in  runtime  self-healing  mechanisms,  self-repairing  code,  test  regeneration,  and  the  growing  role  of  machine  learning  (ML)  and  artificial  intelligence  (AI),  revealing  both  achievements  and  gaps  in  the  field.  \\n3.1.  Runtime  Self-Healing  Systems  \\nRuntime  self-healing  focuses  on  dynamically  adapting  live  systems  to  unexpected  faults  or  performance  degradation.  Netflix’s  Chaos  Monkey  [7]  exemplifies  this  approach  by  intentionally  introducing  failures  in  production  environments  to  test  recovery  mechanisms,  ensuring  system  resilience.  Similarly,  Kubernetes,  a  widely  adopted  container  orchestration  platform,  incorporates  native  self-healing  features  like  automatic  pod  restarts,  node  draining,  and  replica  set  rebalancing  [8].  For  instance,  Kubernetes  might  restart  a  pod  after  detecting  a  crash  via  container  health  checks,  ensuring  availability  but  not  addressing  the  underlying  code  flaw.  These  approaches  rely  on  infrastructure-level  redundancy  and  reactive  failover  mechanisms,  offering  robustness  but  limited  introspection  into  the  root  causes  of  software-level  issues.  While  runtime  self-healing  ensures  system  availability,  it  often  overlooks  code-level  issues,  prompting  the  development  of  self-healing  code  techniques.  \\n3.2.  Self-Healing  Code  \\nSelf-healing  code  takes  a  deeper  approach  by  automatically  identifying  and  fixing  the  root  causes  of  software  bugs.  Tools  like  GenProg  [9]  and  CodePhage  [10]  use  genetic  programming  and  dynamic  patch  transplantation  to  generate  valid  patches  for  crashing  programs.  For  example,  GenProg  mutates  faulty  code  using  a  fitness  function  based  on  passing  test  cases,  iteratively  evolving  a  patch—such  as  adjusting  a  loop  boundary  to  fix  an  off-by-one  error.  More  recent  advancements  leverage  large  language  models  (LLMs)  like  OpenAI’s  Codex  and  GitHub  Copilot  to  suggest  or  synthesize  repairs  from  \\ntest  failures  or  natural  language  prompts  [11].  Codex  might  propose  a  null  check  to  prevent  a  crash,  drawing  on  patterns  from  vast  code  corpora.  While  these  methods  enable  proactive  repairs,  their  effectiveness  varies,  with  GenProg  excelling  in  syntactic  fixes  but  struggling  with  complex,  multi-file  bugs  (Section  3.5).  Beyond  code  repairs,  self-healing  extends  to  testing,  where  automation  addresses  the  growing  challenge  of  flaky  tests  in  CI/CD  pipelines.  \\n3.3.  Self-Healing  Tests  \\nTest  reliability  is  a  critical  concern  in  large  CI/CD  pipelines,  where  flaky  tests  and  outdated  snapshots  often  obstruct  delivery.  Self-healing  testing  frameworks  aim  to  detect,  isolate,  and  repair  test  failures  autonomously.  Techniques  include  flaky  test  detection  by  analyzing  historical  execution  patterns,  snapshot  regeneration  in  UI  frameworks  like  Jest,  and  test  case  synthesis  using  symbolic  execution  or  fuzzing  [12,  13].  For  instance,  tools  might  identify  a  test  that  fails  only  on  certain  OS  versions  due  to  timing  issues,  then  isolate  and  rerun  it  under  controlled  conditions  to  confirm  flakiness.  Some  systems  integrate  with  test  orchestration  platforms  to  auto-rerun  failed  cases  with  controlled  variance,  while  others  use  AI  to  regenerate  test  inputs  or  expected  outputs.  However,  distinguishing  between  flaky  failures  and  genuine  regressions  remains  a  challenge,  often  requiring  manual  oversight.  As  self-healing  tests  improve  CI/CD  reliability,  AI  and  ML  are  now  transforming  the  field  by  enabling  more  intelligent  and  unified  healing  approaches.  \\n3.4.  Role  of  ML  and  AI  in  Code  Understanding  and  Generation  \\nAI’s  growing  influence  in  self-healing  systems  is  driven  by  foundation  models  like  Codex,  CodeT5,  and  PolyCoder,  trained  on  vast  code  corpora  to  infer  intent,  detect  anti-patterns,  and  generate  repairs  [14].  Reinforcement  learning  and  program  synthesis  have  also  been  applied  to  optimize  test  coverage  and  repair  faulty  execution  traces  [15].  For  example,  CodeT5  could  unify  Kubernetes  runtime  signals  (Section  \\n3'),\n",

However,  these  models  require  fine-tuning  to  avoid  overfitting  to  generic  patterns  and  often  struggle  with  domain-specific  logic  or  dynamic  runtime  behavior,  as  they  are  prone  to  hallucinations  and  lack  transparency  in  decision-making  [16].  Despite  these  challenges,  AI  offers  potential  for  end-to-end  healing  by  integrating  observability  data  (e.g.,  logs)  with  repair  logic,  though  issues  like  domain-specific  reasoning  remain  unresolved  (Section  3.5).  \\n3.5.  Shortcomings  in  Current  Approaches  \\nDespite  advancements,  current  self-healing  systems  exhibit  several  critical  limitations  that  hinder  their  ability  to  provide  comprehensive,  reliable  solutions.  These  gaps,  observed  across  runtime,  code,  and  test  healing  approaches,  highlight  the  need  for  a  unified,  semantic-aware  framework  like  the  one  proposed  in  Section  4.  \\nSiloed  Healing :  Most  tools  focus  on  a  single  aspect—runtime  recovery  (e.g.,  Kubernetes  pod  restarts),  code  repair  (e.g.,  GenProg),  or  test  automation  (e.g.,  flaky  test  detection)—without  integrating  these  efforts  into  a  cohesive  feedback  loop.  For  example,  Chaos  Monkey  (Section  3.1)  excels  at  runtime  failure  injection  but  cannot  address  code-level  bugs,  leaving  gaps  in  end-to-end  healing.   \\nLack  of  Semantic  Understanding :  Machine  learning-based  code  generators  often  fail  to  grasp  business-specific  constraints  or  complex  architectural  dependencies.  For  instance,  GenProg’s  genetic  programming  can  patch  a  crashing  loop  with  a  syntactic  fix,  such  as  adjusting  an  index,  but  struggles  with  bugs  requiring  multi-file  reasoning—like  a  data  race  across  microservices—due  to  its  lack  of  awareness  of  broader  program  semantics.  Similarly,  LLMs  like  Codex  may  generate  plausible  fixes,  such  as  adding  a  null  check  to  a  variable,  but  without  understanding   \\ndomain-specific  logic,  they  risk  breaking  constraints,  like  financial  calculations  in  a  banking  app  where  rounding  errors  could  violate  regulations.  \\nLimited  Real-Time  Adaptability :  Many  self-healing  systems  operate  offline  or  require  substantial  retraining  and  human  oversight,  reducing  their  effectiveness  in  dynamic  environments.  For  example,  tools  relying  on  historical  test  patterns  (Section  3.3)  may  fail  to  adapt  to  sudden  spikes  in  user  traffic,  necessitating  manual  intervention  to  retrain  models,  which  delays  recovery.  \\nEvaluation  Gaps :  There  is  a  lack  of  standardized  benchmarks  to  assess  the  robustness,  safety,  and  long-term  maintainability  of  AI-generated  repairs.  While  tools  like  Codex  achieve  high  success  rates  for  isolated  fixes  (Section  5.4),  their  patches  may  degrade  over  time—e.g.,  a  fix  passing  tests  today  might  fail  under  new  workloads—highlighting  the  need  for  longitudinal  evaluation  metrics.  \\nThese  shortcomings  underscore  the  necessity  for  a  holistic,  context-aware  approach.  GenProg’s  struggles  with  architectural  dependencies  and  Codex’s  limitations  in  domain-specific  scenarios  (e.g.,  introducing  subtle  errors  in  financial  logic)  reveal  the  critical  need  for  semantic-aware  healing.  The  proposed  AI-driven  architecture  (Section  4)  aims  to  address  these  gaps  by  unifying  observability,  diagnosis,  and  repair  in  a  feedback-driven  loop,  enabling  more  robust  and  adaptive  self-healing  systems.  \\nThe  following  table  summarizes  key  approaches  to  self-healing  in  software  systems.

However,  gaps  in  semantic  understanding,  real-time  adaptability,  and  evaluation  standards  persist,  as  detailed  in  Section  3.5.  These  shortcomings  highlight  the  need  for  a  unified,  AI-driven  approach,  which  our  proposed  framework  (Section  4)  aims  to  address  by  integrating  observability,  diagnosis,  and  repair  in  a  cohesive  loop.   \\n4.  Proposed  Framework:  AI-Driven  Self-Healing  Architecture  \\nInspired  by  the  self-healing  nature  of  biological  systems,  we  propose  a  modular  AI-driven  architecture  for  autonomous  software  repair.  This  framework  mirrors  biological  healing,  where  the  brain  interprets  signals  and  initiates  immune  responses,  reimagining  this  process  within  a  modern  software  infrastructure.  The  pipeline  begins  with  monitoring  tools  collecting  signals  (e.g.,  error  logs,  performance  metrics),  which  the  diagnosis  module  analyzes  using  historical  data,  bench  marks  and  AI  models  to  pinpoint  faults.  The  healing  agent  then  applies  a  fix,  such  as  a  code  patch  or  test  rewrite,  which  the  verification  unit  tests  in  a  sandbox.  Finally,  the  CI/CD  loop  deploys  the  fix  or  flags  it  for  review  based  on  predefined  policies,  ensuring  a  seamless,  adaptive  healing  process.  \\n4.1.  Signal  Collection  \\nThe  first  step  mirrors  the  nervous  system  sensing  pain  or  inflammation  in  the  human  body,  collecting  signals  that  indicate  system  stress,  failure,  or  degradation.  Monitoring  tools  like  Datadog,  Grafana,  New  Relic,  and  Prometheus  provide  metrics,  logs,  and  traces  to  identify  symptoms  of  failure  [7].  For  example,  Prometheus  might  scrape  a  CPU  spike  of  90%  on  a  critical  server,  while  OpenTelemetry  traces  a  slow  API  request  to  a  database  timeout,  feeding  both  signals  to  the  diagnosis  module.  Advanced  systems  can  incorporate  anomaly  detection  or  tracing-based  root  cause  analysis,  \\nacting  as  neural  sensors  that  channel  data  into  the  “central  AI  nervous  system”  for  further  interpretation.  This  comprehensive  signal  collection  ensures  the  framework  captures  a  wide  range  of  failure  indicators,  setting  the  stage  for  accurate  diagnosis.  \\n4.2.  Diagnosis  Module  \\nOnce  signals  are  collected,  the  diagnosis  module  interprets  them  using  AI  models,  akin  to  the  brain  analyzing  sensory  input  to  identify  injury.  Retrieval-Augmented  Generation  (RAG)  models  pull  historical  context—such  as  past  bug  reports—while  Abstract  Syntax  Tree  (AST)  parsers  and  Large  Language  Models  (LLMs)  like  Codex  or  Copilot  analyze  code  structure  and  semantics  [14].  For  instance,  an  LLM  might  examine  a  stack  trace  alongside  recent  commits  via  RAG,  identifying  a  null  pointer  exception  caused  by  a  new  function  missing  input  validation.  These  models  detect  probable  fault  locations—like  logic  bugs,  unhandled  exceptions,  or  outdated  test  assertions—that  conventional  static  analysis  tools  often  miss.  Unlike  traditional  debugging  tools,  AI-enabled  diagnosis  learns  patterns  over  time  from  a  vast  corpus  of  code  repositories,  improving  its  accuracy  with  each  iteration  [15].  This  module’s  ability  to  combine  historical  data  with  real-time  signals  ensures  precise  fault  localization,  enabling  effective  healing  actions.  \\n4.3.  Healing  Agent  \\nThe  healing  agent,  the  core  of  the  framework,  triggers  repair  actions,  mirroring  the  biological  immune  system’s  role  in  neutralizing  pathogens.  Depending  on  confidence  thresholds  and  organizational  policies,  the  agent  can  recommend  or  automatically  apply  fixes.  For  code  defects,  LLMs  or  genetic  programming  tools  like  GenProg  rewrite  or  mutate  code  based  on  learned  bug-fix  patterns  [9].  For  flaky  tests,  such  as  a  UI  test  failing  due  to  a  changed  DOM,  a  test-oriented  variant  of  CodeT5  regenerates  the  snapshot  to  match  the  updated  element  ID  [14].  Infrastructure  issues,  like  misconfigurations  in  deployment  scripts,  are  corrected  using  \\n5'),\n",

By  addressing  code,  tests,  and  infrastructure,  the  healing  agent  ensures  comprehensive  repairs,  adapting  its  approach  based  on  the  nature  of  the  fault  and  the  system’s  requirements,  paving  the  way  for  rigorous  verification.  \\n4.4.  Verification  Unit  \\nHealing  without  verification  risks  introducing  regressions,  so  the  verification  unit  acts  as  regenerative  tissue  testing  its  integration  before  becoming  permanent.  Fixes  are  evaluated  in  a  sandboxed  environment  through  unit,  integration,  and  end-to-end  test  suites.  Mutation  testing  ensures  the  patch  doesn’t  mask  faults—for  example,  verifying  that  a  fix  doesn’t  pass  tests  by  bypassing  critical  logic  [17].  Canary  deployments  in  pre-production  monitor  key  metrics  like  error  rates  for  10  minutes,  reverting  if  anomalies  occur,  such  as  a  spike  in  500  errors.  If  verification  fails,  the  system  rolls  back  to  the  previous  state,  logging  the  issue  for  developer  analysis  to  maintain  stability.  For  untested  edge  cases,  low-confidence  fixes  are  flagged  for  human  review,  balancing  autonomy  with  safety.  This  rigorous  validation  ensures  that  only  reliable  fixes  are  deployed,  protecting  the  system  from  unintended  consequences.  \\n4.5.  Feedback  Loop  Integration  with  CI/CD  \\nThe  framework  integrates  seamlessly  with  the  organization’s  CI/CD  pipeline,  creating  a  self-sustaining  feedback  loop  that  mirrors  biological  adaptation.  Signals  from  the  monitoring  stack  trigger  healing  actions,  which  are  verified  and  either  rolled  out  automatically  or  flagged  for  manual  review  based  on  thresholds  and  risk  profiles.  Customization  is  supported  via  policy  templates:  startups  might  prioritize  speed  by  auto-applying  all  fixes,  while  enterprises  enforce  strict  review,  flagging  all  code  changes.  Scalability  is  ensured  through  distributed  monitoring  agents  and  cloud-based  AI  inference,  handling  thousands  of  signals  per  second  in  large  systems  [18].  Developers  can  configure  policies—e.g.,  auto-patching  known  flaky  tests  but  flagging  code  refactoring  for  review—fostering  trust  and  enabling  graceful  \\nadoption.  This  feedback  loop  ensures  continuous  improvement,  adapting  the  system  to  evolving  conditions  and  enhancing  its  resilience  over  time.  \\n4.6  Potential  Challenges  \\nResource  Overhead :  Continuous  monitoring  and  AI  inference  may  strain  resources,  particularly  in  low-latency  systems,  requiring  optimization  like  edge-based  processing.  \\nModel  Errors :  LLMs  may  generate  incorrect  patches  (e.g.,  fixing  a  symptom  but  not  the  root  cause),  necessitating  robust  verification.  \\nIntegration  Complexity :  Retrofitting  the  framework  into  legacy  CI/CD  pipelines  may  require  custom  adapters  for  tools  like  Jenkins.'),\n",

By  leveraging  advanced  techniques  like  machine  learning,  code  analysis,  and  predictive  modeling,  these  systems—such  as  the  framework  proposed  in  Section  4—can  identify  anomalies,  bugs,  and  performance  bottlenecks,  achieving  recovery  times  up  to  55–70%  faster  than  manual  fixes,  as  demonstrated  in  the  prototype  (Section  5.4).  This  automation  reduces  the  need  for  human  intervention,  freeing  developers  to  focus  on  strategic  innovation  rather  than  repetitive  error  fixing.  The  biological  analogy  introduced  in  Section  2  provides  an  intuitive  lens:  just  as  the  human  body  uses  neural  signals  to  guide  immune  responses  and  repair  damaged  cells,  self-healing  software  relies  on  AI  to  monitor  logs,  telemetry,  and  error  reports,  directing  the  healing  process  through  modules  like  Signal  Collection  and  Healing  Agent  (Section  4).  \\nThis  analogy’s  strength  lies  in  its  clarity,  making  the  concept  accessible  to  both  technical  and  non-technical  stakeholders.  Like  the  body’s  ability  to  adapt  and  regenerate  post-injury,  software  systems  can  self-correct  and  recover  from  failures,  as  seen  in  the  prototype’s  85–90%  success  rate  for  syntactic  bugs  (Section  5.4).  Continuous  learning,  enabled  by  feedback  loops  (Section  4.5),  fosters  resilience,  allowing  systems  to  evolve  with  changing  conditions.  Looking  ahead,  self-reliant  software  could  manage  its  entire  lifecycle  autonomously,  minimizing  downtime  and  boosting  efficiency.  As  AI  models  advance—addressing  challenges  like  semantic  understanding  and  scalability  (Section  7)—the  vision  of  fully  autonomous,  adaptable  software  systems  becomes  increasingly  achievable,  revolutionizing  software  development  and  support  for  a  more  reliable  \\ndigital\\n \\nfuture.\\n \\n5.  Implementation  &  Prototype  \\nTo  validate  the  proposed  framework,  we  developed  a  proof-of-concept  prototype  that  \\nleverages  AI-driven  healing  mechanisms  within  a  CI/CD  pipeline.  The  prototype  combines  static  code  analysis,  large  language  models  (LLMs),  and  observability  data  to  detect,  diagnose,  and  repair  common  issues  in  code  and  test  suites.  \\nPrototype  Components:  \\n5.1.  Fault  Detection  using  LLM  +  Static  Analysis:   We  employ  abstract  syntax  tree  (AST)  traversal  in  combination  with  large  language  models  (LLMs)  such  as  OpenAI  Codex  to  analyze  code  structure  and  identify  anomalies  or  anti-patterns.  Codex  is  prompted  with  a  template:  ‘Given  error  log  [stack  trace]  and  code  [snippet],  suggest  a  fix.’  AST  traversal  uses  a  TypeScript  parser  to  identify  unhandled  promises,  reducing  false  positives.  By  parsing  the  code  into  its  syntactic  components,  AST  traversal  provides  a  structured  foundation  for  understanding  the  program's  logic.  This  structured  representation  is  then  paired  with  LLMs,  which  are  prompted  using  relevant  context—including  code  snippets,  recent  test  failures,  and  commit  history—to  infer  probable  root  causes  and  suggest  candidate  patches.  This  hybrid  approach  enhances  both  the  precision  of  fault  localization  and  the  quality  of  automated  code  repair.  \\n5.2.  Healing  Workflow  Integration:  The  system  is  seamlessly  integrated  into  both  GitHub  Actions  workflows  and  Jenkins  pipelines  to  enable  automated  response  to  build  failures  or  test  crashes.  When  such  an  event  is  detected,  relevant  logs  and  code  diffs  are  immediately  collected  to  provide  context.  Logs  are  parsed  using  regex  to  extract  error  codes,  which  are  fed  to  Codex  alongside  the  last  10  commits  from  Git.  Patches  are  applied  via  a  GitHub  Actions  step  that  creates  a  temporary  branch.  This  information  is  then  passed  to  a  large  language  model  (LLM),  which  generates  patch  suggestions  and  rewrites  test  cases  based  on  the  observed  issue.  The  continuous  integration  (CI)  system  subsequently  applies  the  proposed  fix  in  a  temporary  branch  and  executes  a  full  suite  of  validation  tests  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  correction,  ensuring  \\n7\"),\n",

Verification  &  Feedback  Loop:   A  sandboxed  test  suite  is  employed  to  validate  the  auto-generated  fix  in  a  controlled  and  isolated  environment.  This  process  includes  re-running  unit  and  integration  tests  to  confirm  that  the  fix  resolves  the  issue  without  introducing  new  problems.  If  a  patch  fails  verification  (e.g.,  new  test  failures),  the  system  reverts  the  temporary  branch  and  retries  with  an  alternative  fix  up  to  three  times.  Persistent  failures  trigger  a  developer  alert  with  diagnostic  logs,  ensuring  no  silent  errors  disrupt  the  pipeline.  \\nAdditionally,  mutation  testing  is  conducted  to  ensure  regression  resistance  and  robustness  of  the  updated  code.  Mutation  testing  uses  PIT  to  inject  faults,  ensuring  the  patch  doesn’t  bypass  critical  logic.  If  the  system  is  operating  in  a  semi-autonomous  mode,  an  optional  human  review  is  triggered  via  pull  request  comments,  allowing  developers  to  inspect  and  approve  the  proposed  changes  before  final  integration.  This  layered  validation  approach  balances  automation  with  oversight  to  maintain  software  quality  and  trust.  \\n5.4  Simulation  Environment:  To  assess  effectiveness,  we  ran  experiments  involving:  \\nSynthetic  Bug  Injection:  To  evaluate  the  effectiveness  and  responsiveness  of  the  self-healing  prototype,  we  systematically  introduced  synthetic  bugs  into  JavaScript  and  TypeScript  codebases.  These  injected  bugs  mimicked  real-world  scenarios  commonly  encountered  in  production  environments,  such  as  off-by-one  errors  in  loops  or  array  indexing,  missing  null  or  undefined  checks,  improper  type  handling,  and  misconfigured  asynchronous  logic.  In  parallel,  we  also  induced  common  test-related  failures  like  outdated  snapshot  tests,  brittle  assertions,  and  unhandled  async  test  cases.  This  controlled  injection  of  faults  provided  a  reliable  basis  for  assessing  how  well  the  system  could  detect,  diagnose,  and  repair  \\ndiverse  classes  of  errors  under  realistic  conditions.  \\nAutonomous  Healing  Trigger:  Once  a  build  failure  or  test  crash  was  detected  through  the  CI/CD  pipeline,  the  system's  autonomous  healing  logic  was  automatically  activated.  This  included  capturing  contextual  information  such  as  error  logs,  stack  traces,  diffs  from  recent  commits,  and  test  outputs.  The  large  language  model  (LLM),  integrated  into  the  workflow,  then  analyzed  this  context  and  generated  candidate  patches  or  test  case  rewrites.  These  suggestions  were  automatically  applied  in  a  temporary  Git  branch,  triggering  a  fresh  CI  run.  The  healing  process  was  fully  automated,  enabling  the  prototype  to  attempt  immediate  recovery  without  human  intervention.  In  semi-autonomous  mode,  the  system  would  also  notify  developers  with  pull  request  comments  summarizing  the  patch  and  offering  optional  manual  approval.  \\nRecovery  Time  vs.  Manual  Fixing:  To  measure  the  practical  impact  of  the  system,  we  benchmarked  the  recovery  time  of  the  self-healing  mechanism  against  traditional  developer-led  debugging  and  patching.  The  metric  focused  on  the  duration  from  the  initial  failure  detection  to  a  passing  build.  Preliminary  results  indicated  that  for  a  wide  range  of  common  fault  classes—particularly  those  involving  syntax  issues,  small  logic  bugs,  and  flaky  tests—the  system  achieved  resolution  times  55–70%  faster  than  manual  fixes.  These  improvements  were  realized  without  compromising  code  quality,  as  validated  by  post-repair  test  suites  and  mutation  testing.  This  performance  highlights  the  potential  of  AI-assisted  healing  to  significantly  accelerate  the  development  lifecycle,  reduce  mean  time  to  repair  (MTTR),  and  alleviate  developer  toil  in  continuous  integration  workflows.  \\nObservations:  \\nDuring  evaluation,  the  system  showed  high  effectiveness  for  syntactic  or  localized  bugs —like  off-by-one  errors,  missing\"),\n",

As  shown  in  Section  5.4,  the  prototype  achieved  85–90%  accuracy  for  syntactic  bugs  using  AST  and  LLM  analysis,  outperforming  static  tools  like  ESLint.

This  metric  measures  how  often  the  AI  model  can  apply  fixes  (such  as  code  patches  or  test  rewrites)  that  are  both  correct  and  effective,  without  introducing  additional  errors  or  regressions.  This  follows  work  in  automated  program  repair,  where  test-suite-based  repair  systems  like  Recoder  or  AlphaRepair  demonstrated  success  rates  ranging  from  45%  to  over  70%  in  benchmark  suites,  depending  on  fault  type  and  test  coverage  [20].  \\n6.3  Developer  Effort  Saved :  \\nQuantified  by  comparing  developer  hours  spent  debugging  with  and  without  the  system,  using  time-tracking  tools.

The  time  taken  for  the  system  to  recover  from  failures  or  bugs,  comparing  the  time  taken  for  AI-based  healing  vs.  manual  intervention.  Shorter  recovery  times  indicate  more  efficient  healing  processes,  directly  improving  system  uptime.

This  baseline  allows  \\nfor  an  objective  comparison  of  the  AI-driven  approach's  performance  in  real-world  scenarios  and  offers  insights  into  the  areas  where  automation  excels  or  requires  further  improvement.  Beyond  effectiveness,  we  assess  computational  overhead  (e.g.,  seconds  per  patch)  and  patch  maintainability  (e.g.,  percentage  of  patches  requiring  rework  within  30  days)  to  ensure  practical  deployment.  The  system  is  compared  to  static  analysis  tools  like  ESLint  for  syntactic  bugs  and  SapFix  for  code  repairs,  as  well  as  manual  debugging  by  developers  with  5+  years  of  experience.  Scenarios  include  flaky  test  resolution  in  CI  pipelines  and  runtime  crashes  in  Node.js  applications.  A  similar  comparative  methodology  was  employed  in  [21],  where  the  efficacy  and  practicality  of  automated  repair  tools  were  evaluated  against  developer-written  patches  and  static  analysis  systems.  \\nFollowing  Table  summarizes  the  metrics  with  example  values  from  the  prototype,  illustrating  the  framework’s  potential  impact.  \\nMetric  Description  Example  Value  \\nBug  Detection  Accuracy  \\nF1-score  of  detected  bugs  \\n85%  for  syntactic  bugs  \\nRepair  Success  Rate  \\n%  of  patches  passing  tests  \\n80%  overall  \\nDeveloper  Effort  Saved   \\nHours  saved  vs.  manual  debugging  \\n10  hours/week   \\nTime  to  Recovery   \\nTime  from  failure  to  passing  build  \\n15  minutes  vs.  45  (manual)  \\nBaseline  Comparison   \\nAI  vs.  static  tools  (success  rate)  \\n20%  higher  than  ESLint  \\n  6.6  Challenges  in  Evaluation  \\nBug  Detection  Accuracy :  False  positives  may  inflate  accuracy  if  edge  cases  are  underrepresented  in  test  datasets.\"),\n",

Challenges  &  Limitations  \\n7.1  False  Positives  or  Wrong  Patches  \\nA  critical  challenge  in  AI-driven  self-healing  systems  is  the  risk  of  false  positives  or  incorrect  patches,  which  can  disrupt  system  stability.  False  positives  occur  when  the  system  identifies  a  non-existent  issue,  while  wrong  patches  fail  to  address  the  root  cause  or  introduce  new  bugs.  For  example,  the  Diagnosis  Module  (Section  4.2)  might  misinterpret  a  temporary  spike  in  CPU  usage—captured  via  Prometheus  metrics—as  a  performance  bug,  triggering  an  unnecessary  optimization  patch  that  increases  latency  by  10%,  as  observed  in  the  prototype’s  10%  false  positive  rate  for  complex  bugs  (Section  5.4).  This  issue  stems  from  the  system’s  limited  ability  to  fully  interpret  the  context  of  the  application,  including  its  dependencies,  environment,  and  runtime  behavior.  In  one  prototype  test,  the  AI  flagged  a  database  query  as  the  cause  of  a  timeout  based  on  historical  patterns,  but  the  true  issue  was  a  network  latency  spike,  leading  to  an  ineffective  fix.  To  address  this,  we  propose  using  ensemble  learning  to  combine  LLMs  with  anomaly  detection  models,  cross-validating  bug  detection  to  reduce  false  positives.  Additionally,  integrating  feedback  loops—where  developer  rejections  of  incorrect  patches  fine-tune  Codex’s  weights—can  enable  the  system  to  learn  from  mistakes.  For  critical  patches,  manual  oversight  via  pull  request  reviews  (as  implemented  in  the  \\nprototype’s  semi-autonomous  mode,  Section  5.3)  ensures  reliability,  minimizing  disruptions  while  improving  the  accuracy  of  AI-driven  healing  over  time.  \\n7.2  Over-Reliance  on  AI  Hallucinations  \\nWhat  happens  when  an  AI  generates  a  harmful  fix?  AI  hallucinations—where  models  produce  plausible  but  incorrect  outputs—pose  a  significant  risk  in  self-healing  systems.  In  code  repair,  the  Healing  Agent  (Section  4.3)  might  generate  a  seemingly  valid  but  flawed  patch,  such  as  adding  an  incorrect  null  check  to  a  TypeScript  async  function,  breaking  the  API  flow  in  5%  of  the  prototype’s  test  cases  (Section  5.4).  This  issue  arises  because  LLMs,  like  Codex,  rely  on  historical  patterns  without  fully  understanding  the  underlying  issue  or  broader  codebase,  potentially  leading  to  catastrophic  failures  in  production.  For  instance,  a  hallucinated  patch  might  bypass  a  security  check,  exposing  vulnerabilities.  The  core  risk  lies  in  the  model’s  inability  to  independently  verify  its  suggestions  against  real-world  outcomes.  To  mitigate  this,  we  propose  using  constrained  decoding  to  limit  LLM  outputs  to  syntactically  valid  patches,  ensuring  they  align  with  the  codebase’s  structure.  Additionally,  integrating  mutation  testing  (Section  4.4)  into  the  verification  pipeline  can  catch  harmful  fixes  by  simulating  fault  scenarios—e.g.,  ensuring  a  patch  doesn’t  mask  a  deeper  logic  error.  Limiting  autonomy  in  high-stakes  scenarios,  such  as  financial  applications,  and  using  explainability  tools  like  SHAP  to  provide  developers  with  insights  into  AI  decisions  further  ensures  trustworthiness.  These  layered  checks,  combined  with  the  prototype’s  CI  testing  (Section  5.2),  help  balance  automation  with  reliability,  preventing  harmful  hallucinations  from  impacting  system  integrity.  This  challenge  is  widely  acknowledged  in  recent  studies  on  LLMs  in  software  engineering,  such  as  [22],  which  highlights  risks  of  misleading  or  faulty  code  completions  produced  by  state-of-the-art  models.  \\n11'),\n",

Code  embodies  not  just  instructions  but  also  the  logic  and  goals  of  its  creator,  requiring  the  AI  to  understand  both  its  technical  structure  and  the  broader  context  in  which  it  operates.  Without  this  understanding,  fixes  may  be  syntactically  correct  but  functionally  disastrous.  For  instance,  in  the  prototype  (Section  5.4),  the  Healing  Agent  (Section  4.3)  attempted  to  fix  a  syntax  error  in  a  payment  processing  function  by  adjusting  a  loop  boundary,  but  this  broke  the  transaction  logic,  contributing  to  the  40–50%  success  rate  for  semantic  bugs.  The  AI  lacked  insight  into  the  function’s  role  in  ensuring  financial  accuracy,  disrupting  the  application’s  workflow.  To  address  this,  the  system  must  go  beyond  syntax  analysis  and  incorporate  semantic  understanding  of  the  code’s  logic,  dependencies,  and  intended  outcomes.  We  propose  using  program  slicing  to  isolate  relevant  code  dependencies—e.g.,  tracing  variables  affecting  the  payment  function—and  prompting  LLMs  with  summarized  function  comments  extracted  via  NLP  tools  like  BERT  to  capture  intent.  Additionally,  integrating  developer  input  through  annotations  or  feedback  during  the  healing  process  (as  seen  in  the  prototype’s  semi-autonomous  mode,  Section  5.3)  ensures  patches  align  with  the  code’s  goals,  reducing  unintended  side  effects  and  improving  the  system’s  ability  to  handle  context-sensitive  repairs.  Similar  challenges  and  techniques  for  capturing  intent  in  automated  program  repair  are  discussed  in  [23],  which  emphasizes  the  role  of  intent-aware  models  in  improving  repair  accuracy.  \\n7.4  Ethical  and  Accountability  Concerns  \\nIn  mission-critical  systems  like  healthcare,  can  fully  autonomous  healing  be  trusted?  The  deployment  of  AI-driven  self-healing  systems  raises  profound  ethical  and  accountability  concerns,  particularly  regarding  automation’s  unintended  consequences.  When  the  Healing  \\nAgent  (Section  4.3)  autonomously  applies  a  patch,  accountability  for  failures—such  as  a  security  vulnerability  exposing  patient  data—becomes  unclear:  is  the  developer,  the  organization,  or  the  AI  responsible?  This  ambiguity  is  critical  in  domains  like  healthcare,  finance,  or  transportation,  where  errors  can  have  severe  consequences.  In  the  prototype’s  tests  (Section  5.4),  5%  of  patches  introduced  subtle  regressions,  underscoring  the  risk  in  high-stakes  scenarios.  Ethical  concerns  also  extend  to  transparency  and  fairness,  as  AI  models  may  perpetuate  biases  from  flawed  training  data,  potentially  prioritizing  certain  bug  types  over  others.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  we  propose  adopting  OpenTelemetry  for  detailed  change  logging,  capturing  every  AI  action  for  audit  trails.  Explainability  tools  like  SHAP  can  provide  developers  with  insights  into  AI  decisions—e.g.,  why  a  patch  was  applied—enhancing  transparency.  The  prototype’s  semi-autonomous  mode  (Section  5.3)  already  flags  high-risk  patches  for  human  review,  and  this  human-in-the-loop  approach  must  remain  integral,  especially  in  sensitive  applications.  Finally,  ensuring  fairness  requires  curating  diverse  training  data  and  using  fairness-aware  algorithms  to  prevent  biased  healing  decisions,  fostering  trust  in  AI-driven  systems.  Ethical  considerations  and  governance  strategies  for  AI  in  critical  infrastructure  are  further  explored  in  [24],  highlighting  the  importance  of  accountability,  auditability,  and  human  oversight.  \\n7.5  Scalability  and  Integration  Challenges  \\nThe  framework’s  reliance  on  real-time  AI  inference  may  incur  high  computational  costs,  particularly  for  large  codebases  with  frequent  CI/CD  runs.  For  example,  processing  1,000  signals/second  could  require  a  dedicated  GPU  cluster,  challenging  resource-constrained  teams.  Additionally,  integrating  with  legacy  systems  lacking  modern  observability  tools  (e.g.,  Prometheus)  may  require  custom  adapters,  increasing  setup  complexity.  Solutions  include  lightweight  models  (e.g.,  distilled  CodeT5)  and  modular  APIs  for  legacy  compatibility.'),\n",

Future  Directions\\n \\nFuture  work  may  explore  addressing  current  limitations  such  as  context  sensitivity  (Section  7.3)  and  accountability  (Section  7.4).  Improving  these  aspects  could  enhance  the  robustness,  scalability,  and  trustworthiness  of  AI-driven  self-healing  systems,  supporting  their  adoption  in  real-world  scenarios.  \\n8.1  Integration  with  Observability  Platforms  \\nImagine  a  latency  spike  undetected  by  logs  alone—observability  platforms  can  bridge  this  gap.  Integrating  self-healing  systems  with  tools  like  Datadog,  Grafana,  and  Prometheus  significantly  enhances  their  effectiveness  by  providing  a  comprehensive  view  of  system  health.  The  Signal  Collection  module  (Section  4.1),  which  currently  relies  on  basic  logs,  could  incorporate  Grafana  dashboards  to  correlate  a  500ms  latency  spike  with  a  specific  API  endpoint,  triggering  the  Diagnosis  Module  to  analyze  recent  commits.  This  integration  enables  a  seamless  flow  of  real-time  telemetry,  logs,  and  error  tracking  data  into  AI-driven  healing  models,  improving  fault  diagnosis  precision.  By  combining  code  analysis  with  \\ntelemetry,  the  system  can  pinpoint  root  causes—like  a  memory  leak  tied  to  a  recent  deployment—with  30%  faster  bug  detection  compared  to  log-only  approaches.  Additionally,  feedback  from  observability  platforms  can  fine-tune  the  healing  process,  enabling  adaptation  to  evolving  operational  conditions  and  reducing  downtime  in  dynamic  environments.  \\n8.2  More  Robust  Multi-Modal  Models  (Code  +  Logs  +  Telemetry)  \\nHow  can  the  system  better  understand  failures?  Multi-modal  models  offer  a  solution  by  analyzing  data  from  multiple  sources—code,  logs,  and  telemetry—to  provide  a  holistic  view  of  system  behavior.  Traditional  approaches  often  rely  on  a  single  data  stream,  missing  critical  context.  A  multi-modal  transformer  could  fuse  log  data  (e.g.,  error  frequency),  telemetry  (e.g.,  memory  usage),  and  code  embeddings  (via  CodeBERT)  to  predict  a  memory  leak’s  root  cause  with  15%  higher  accuracy  than  the  prototype’s  40–50%  success  rate  for  semantic  bugs  (Section  5.4).  This  addresses  context  sensitivity  (Section  7.3)  by  enriching  the  Diagnosis  Module  (Section  4.2)  with  diverse  data,  enabling  it  to  correlate  a  spike  in  failed  requests  with  a  specific  code  change.  Such  models  can  interpret  complex  interactions—like  code  dependencies  and  resource  usage  patterns—generating  contextually  appropriate  fixes.  Continuous  learning  from  multi-modal  data  also  allows  the  system  to  adapt  to  new  failure  patterns,  reducing  false  positives  by  15%  and  ensuring  healing  actions  align  with  actual  system  needs  across  diverse  environments.  The  effectiveness  of  multi-modal  transformers  for  software  maintenance  and  diagnostics  has  been  demonstrated  in  recent  studies  that  show  their  superior  ability  to  learn  complex  correlations  across  diverse  inputs  [25].  \\n8.3  Reinforcement  Learning  for  Adaptive  Healing  \\nThe  prototype  struggled  with  recurring  bugs—reinforcement  learning  (RL)  can  address  \\n13'),\n",

RL  enables  self-healing  systems  to  dynamically  adapt  by  learning  from  continuous  feedback,  unlike  static  ML  models.  An  RL  agent  could  be  trained  with  a  reward  function  based  on  recovery  time,  learning  to  prioritize  test  rewrites  over  code  patches  for  flaky  UI  tests,  building  on  the  prototype’s  80%  test  repair  success  (Section  5.4).  For  example,  if  a  bug  type  repeatedly  occurs  in  a  specific  module,  the  agent  adjusts  its  strategy—e.g.,  favoring  configuration  fixes  over  code  changes—targeting  a  25%  improvement  in  recovery  time  for  recurring  issues.  This  iterative  learning  optimizes  healing  actions,  tailoring  them  to  the  system’s  unique  patterns  and  minimizing  manual  intervention.  RL  also  facilitates  autonomous  decision-making  by  evaluating  and  prioritizing  healing  strategies  based  on  their  likelihood  of  success,  addressing  challenges  like  false  positives  (Section  7.1)  and  enhancing  efficiency  in  dynamic  environments.  \\n8.4  Trust  and  Explainability  Frameworks  \\nWill  developers  trust  AI  without  transparency?  As  AI-driven  self-healing  systems  integrate  into  critical  applications,  trust  and  explainability  are  essential  for  adoption.  Developers  need  confidence  in  automated  fixes,  especially  in  production  environments.  Using  explainable  AI  (XAI)  techniques  like  SHAP,  the  system  could  highlight  that  a  patch  was  triggered  by  a  log  entry  showing  10  failed  requests,  increasing  trust  in  the  Healing  Agent’s  decisions  (Section  4.3).  This  transparency  addresses  accountability  concerns  (Section  7.4),  as  seen  in  the  prototype’s  semi-autonomous  mode  where  60–65%  of  patches  were  accepted  with  minimal  edits  (Section  5.4).  Explainability  also  aids  debugging  by  identifying  suboptimal  decisions—e.g.,  a  patch  ignoring  a  dependency—aiming  for  90%  developer  satisfaction  in  understanding  AI  actions,  measured  via  surveys.  Embedding  these  frameworks  ensures  AI-driven  fixes  align  with  business  objectives,  fostering  confidence  in  mission-critical  applications  like  healthcare  and  finance.  \\n9.  Conclusion  \\nAI-driven  self-healing  systems  offer  a  transformative  vision  for  software  maintenance,  automating  the  detection,  diagnosis,  and  resolution  of  issues  in  real-time.  By  leveraging  advanced  techniques  like  machine  learning,  code  analysis,  and  predictive  modeling,  these  systems—such  as  the  framework  proposed  in  Section  4—can  identify  anomalies,  bugs,  and  performance  bottlenecks,  achieving  recovery  times  up  to  55–70%  faster  than  manual  fixes,  as  demonstrated  in  the  prototype  (Section  5.4).  This  automation  reduces  the  need  for  human  intervention,  freeing  developers  to  focus  on  strategic  innovation  rather  than  repetitive  error  fixing.  The  biological  analogy  introduced  in  Section  2  provides  an  intuitive  lens:  just  as  the  human  body  uses  neural  signals  to  guide  immune  responses  and  repair  damaged  cells,  self-healing  software  relies  on  AI  to  monitor  logs,  telemetry,  and  error  reports,  directing  the  healing  process  through  modules  like  Signal  Collection  and  Healing  Agent  (Section  4).  \\nThis  analogy’s  strength  lies  in  its  clarity,  making  the  concept  accessible  to  both  technical  and  non-technical  stakeholders.  Like  the  body’s  ability  to  adapt  and  regenerate  post-injury,  software  systems  can  self-correct  and  recover  from  failures,  as  seen  in  the  prototype’s  85–90%  success  rate  for  syntactic  bugs  (Section  5.4).  Continuous  learning,  enabled  by  feedback  loops  (Section  4.5),  fosters  resilience,  allowing  systems  to  evolve  with  changing  conditions.  Looking  ahead,  self-reliant  software  could  manage  its  entire  lifecycle  autonomously,  minimizing  downtime  and  boosting  efficiency.  As  AI  models  advance—addressing  challenges  like  semantic  understanding  and  scalability  (Section  7)—the  vision  of  fully  autonomous,  adaptable  software  systems  becomes  increasingly  achievable,  revolutionizing  software  development  and  support  for  a  more  reliable  digital  future.'),\n",

A  multi-modal  transformer  could  fuse  log  data  (e.g.,  error  frequency),  telemetry  (e.g.,  memory  usage),  and  code  embeddings  (via  CodeBERT)  to  predict  a  memory  leak’s  root  cause  with  15%  higher  accuracy  than  the  prototype’s  40–50%  success  rate  for  semantic  bugs  (Section  5.4).  This  addresses  context  sensitivity  (Section  7.3)  by  enriching  the  Diagnosis  Module  (Section  4.2)  with  diverse  data,  enabling  it  to  correlate  a  spike  in  failed  requests  with  a  specific  code  change.  Such  models  can  interpret  complex  interactions—like  code  dependencies  and  resource  usage  patterns—generating  contextually'),\n",

RL  enables  self-healing  systems  to  dynamically  adapt  by  learning  from  continuous  feedback,  unlike  static  ML  models.  An  RL  agent  could  be  trained  with  a  reward  function  based  on  recovery  time,  learning  to  prioritize  test  rewrites  over  code  patches  for  flaky  UI  tests,  building  on  the  prototype’s  80%  test  repair  success  (Section  5.4).  For  example,  if  a  bug  type  repeatedly  occurs  in  a  specific  module,  the  agent  adjusts  its  strategy—e.g.,  favoring  configuration  fixes  over  code  changes—targeting  a  25%  improvement  in  recovery  time  for  recurring  issues.

As  AI-driven  self-healing  systems  integrate  into  critical  applications,  trust  and  explainability  are  essential  for  adoption.

Using  explainable  AI  (XAI)  techniques  like  SHAP,  the  system  could  highlight  that  a  patch  was  triggered  by  a  log  entry  showing  10  failed  requests,  increasing  trust  in  the  Healing  Agent’s  decisions  (Section  4.3).
